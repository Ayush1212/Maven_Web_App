        <p>In Jenkins, a pipeline is a series of steps that are defined in a Jenkinsfile and executed in the order that they are defined. The Jenkins pipeline allows for multiple steps, including building, testing, and deploying code, to be executed automatically based on predefined conditions. It is a way to define and automate processes in a Jenkins environment, allowing for the creation of a continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
